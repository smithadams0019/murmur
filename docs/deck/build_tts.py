"""Strip the narration down to the words a text-to-speech engine should read.

Generated from `video-narration.txt` so the two cannot drift -- edit that file,
then re-run this. Removes the [CUE] markers, the (parenthetical) holds and the
>> recording notes, unwraps the hard line breaks into flowing sentences, and
softens the punctuation TTS engines read badly:

  - an em dash is silent in most engines, so sentences run together. Replaced
    with a full stop or a comma depending on what follows.
  - "the 57" becomes "the fifty-seven", which every engine gets right anyway,
    so numbers already written as words are left alone.
